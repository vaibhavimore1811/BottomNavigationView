# BottomNavigationView
BottomNavigationView is a UI component in Android that provides a navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. It's typically used to switch between different sections or pages of an app. Each item in the BottomNavigationView represents a separate destination within the app.

Key features of BottomNavigationView:

Menu Items: It displays a set of menu items, often represented by icons and labels, that users can interact with. Each menu item corresponds to a different section or view within the app.

Item Selection: When a user taps on a menu item, the BottomNavigationView handles the selection and, if required, triggers a navigation event to switch to the corresponding destination.

Shift Mode: By default, when you have more than three menu items, the labels associated with the menu items are shifted to the side. This behavior can be customized based on your app's design.

Badge Count: You can attach a badge to a menu item to indicate notifications or updates related to that section.
